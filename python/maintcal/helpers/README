This directory includes scripts that are utilities outside of the scope
of the running application. Currently this includes three scripts that were
used to parse, clean and run explain analyze statements generated from the
SQL Alchemy echo log, which in turn was generated by a run against the
the Maintenance Calendar's unit test suite.
